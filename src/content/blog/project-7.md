Dapp for photo sharing which makes every uploaded image as an NFT which can be sold, transfered and bought


## Table of contents


## Issues addressed
- Ownership: Images of artwork or photographs uploaded by users on social media platforms can be easily duplicated and forged. Hence, the assetâ€™s original owner may not receive any credit for their work. Our system ensures the image's authenticity by creating a non-fungible token (NFT) for the asset.

- Uniqueness: An asset can be duplicated and uploaded as original content by another user. This poses a huge issue for the creators as the originality of an asset cannot be determined. This Daap checks the uniqueness of an image uploaded and assigns a score for each asset using image recognition algorithms. This helps in identifying duplicate assets on the platform.

- Trading: Traditional platforms do not provide a straightforward transparent way of selling/buying digital assets. NFTs can be more easily traded and widely marketed. The actual transfer of the property and funds can be completed securely and nearly instantaneously. This DApp can assist users in selling their images as NFTs. Users will be able to commercialize their content through Ethereum blockchain-based payment systems, where users can be paid directly for their work.

- Data security/privacy: Social media platforms have been under scrutiny for misuse of user data, data breaches, and illegal data access. This is a significant privacy issue that a blockchain can address. This DApp is built on blockchain technology which ensures the security of user data and the privacy of the user.

## Digital Asset and Token
- Digital asset:
The images that users upload on the social media platform. The images can be anything such as artwork or a photograph. These assets can be traded and transferred as NFTs
- Token: 
PhotoSharingNFT - An ERC721 token

Photo Sharing Social Media NFT Decentralized Application uses blockchain technology to solve the above-mentioned issues. It provides users with a secure way to share their photos using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to verify the authenticity and uniqueness of each photo. The DApp also employs image recognition algorithms to ensure that no duplicates or copies of the images exist on the platform and a uniqueness rating is given for each upload on the platform. 

This verification process ensures that the photos shared on the platform are original and unique. Users can also sell and buy the NFTs on the platform, the value of the asset appreciates or depreciates based on the uniqueness of the image. This Dapp can serve as a transparent and secure way for photographers and photo enthusiasts to share their work by combining photo-sharing, NFTs, and image uniqueness verification.

The DAPP is created using React as the web framework.
